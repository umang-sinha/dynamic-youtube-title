## Update YouTube Title Dynamically

The title of this YouTube video changes dynamically according to the number of views, likes, dislikes and comments the video receives. This was actually Tom Scott's idea which I tried replicating.

The script in the background runs every 10 minutes so the actual numbers might vary a bit.
